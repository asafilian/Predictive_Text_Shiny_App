# Predictive Text Shiny App
In this project, we are going to build a predictive text Shiny app. To this end, we start with analyzing a large corpus of text documents to discover the relationship between words. The process involves cleaning and analyzing text data, then building and sampling from a predictive text model. Finally, we will build our shiny app. In the current report, we preprocess and analyze the data. Our original corpus includes more than 4 million lines, and over 100 million words. Due to computational resource limitations, we random sub sample the data and get a fraction (30%) of the data. 

**This project is not fully completed. I will report once the shiny app is luanched.**
